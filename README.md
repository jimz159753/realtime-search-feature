# Task #1: Real-Time Search Feature

## Overview

Develop a simple Next.js application using TypeScript that features a real-time search functionality. The search feature should allow users to dynamically filter a static list of objects as they type.

## Requirements

1. **Application Development**
   - **Framework**: Next.js (with TypeScript).
   - **Feature**: Implement real-time search functionality.
   - **Data Source**: Use a static JSON file to simulate the dataset.

2. **Implementation Details**
   - **Search Functionality**: 
     - Create an input field for users to type their search queries.
     - Display results that update in real-time based on the input.
   - **Data Handling**:
     - Store the dataset in a static JSON file.
     - Efficiently load and use the data for real-time search.

3. **Improvement Commentary**
   - **Code Efficiency**:
     - Discuss potential optimizations for handling large datasets.
     - Consider ways to improve search performance.
   - **User Experience**:
     - Suggest enhancements such as debouncing input to minimize re-renders.
     - Add features like search suggestions if applicable.

4. **Testing**
   - **Unit Tests**:
     - Write tests to verify that the search functionality works correctly.
     - Ensure that the input processing and result filtering are accurate.
   - **Integration Tests**:
     - Test interactions between the search component and the data source.
     - Confirm that data loading and filtering functions as expected.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup Next.js with TypeScript**
   - Initialize a new Next.js project with TypeScript support.
   - Install necessary dependencies.

2. **Create Static JSON File**
   - Place a JSON file in the `public` or `data` directory to mock the dataset.
   - Example: `public/data/items.json`.

3. **Develop the Search Component**
   - Implement a search input field.
   - Fetch and load data from the static JSON file.
   - Implement real-time filtering based on user input.

4. **Add Comments and Documentation**
   - Provide detailed commentary in the code about potential improvements and optimizations.

5. **Write Tests**
   - Create unit and integration tests to ensure functionality and data handling.

This markdown provides a comprehensive guide for implementing and improving the real-time search feature, including setup, development, commentary, and testing.

## Installation

To get your development environment ready, you need to install the application's dependencies. 

**Steps:**

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the project where the `package.json` file is located.
3. Run the following command to install all necessary dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

   This command will download and install all the libraries and packages listed in the `package.json` file.

## Running the App

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can start the application in development mode.

**Steps:**

1. Make sure you are still in the root directory of the project.
2. Run the following command to start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

   This command will launch the application, typically accessible at `http://localhost:3000` (or another port if configured differently). You can open this URL in your web browser to view and interact with the app.

## Testing the App

To ensure the application is functioning correctly and that all features work as expected, you can run the test suite.

**Steps:**

1. With the dependencies installed and the development server stopped, run the following command to execute the tests:

    ```bash
    npm run test
    ```

   This command will run all the test cases defined in the project. Tests help verify that the app behaves correctly and that no new changes have broken existing functionality.

## Summary

- **To install the app**, use `npm install`.
- **To run the app**, use `npm run dev`.
- **To test the app**, use `npm run test`.

Following these steps will help you set up, run, and test the application effectively. If you encounter any issues, consult the project's documentation or reach out for support.
